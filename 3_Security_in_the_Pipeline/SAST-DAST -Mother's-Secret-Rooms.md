## 📋 Rooms Overview

I have successfully completed the **SAST**, **DAST**, and **Mother's Secret** rooms as part of the Security in the Pipeline module. These rooms provided comprehensive practical experience in application security testing methodologies.

## 🎯 Completed Rooms

### 1. 🔍 SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
**Focus:** Identifying vulnerabilities through source code analysis without executing the application

### 2. 🎯 DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) 
**Focus:** Identifying vulnerabilities through running application testing and interaction

### 3. 🕵️ Mother's Secret
**Focus:** Practical code analysis and exploitation challenge applying SAST/DAST principles

## 🔗 Complete Writeups Available

I've documented my complete learning journey and solutions for these rooms in my Security Engineer Learning Path repository:
