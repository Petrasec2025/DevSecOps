*My Journey into Modern Software Security*

## 🎯 Path Overview

I'm embarking on TryHackMe's **DevSecOps Learning Path** to specialize in securing modern development pipelines and infrastructure. This comprehensive path will transform my understanding of product security from traditional approaches to cutting-edge DevSecOps practices.

## 🚀 What I'm Going to Learn

### **Section 1: Secure Software Development**
- **Introduction to DevSecOps** - Foundation of shifting security left
- **SDLC** - Traditional Software Development Life Cycle
- **SSDLC** - Secure Software Development Life Cycle principles

### **Section 2: Security of the Pipeline**
- **Pipeline Automation** - Automating security in CI/CD
- **Source Code Security** - Protecting code repositories and version control
- **CI/CD and Build Security** - Securing continuous integration and deployment

### **Section 3: Security in the Pipeline**
- **Dependency Management** - Managing third-party risks
- **SAST** - Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST** - Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **Mother's Secret** - Practical code analysis challenge

### **Section 4: Container Security**
- **Containerisation Fundamentals** - Understanding container technology
- **Docker Security** - Container runtime security
- **Kubernetes Security** - Orchestration platform security
- **Container Vulnerabilities** - Identifying and mitigating risks
- **Container Hardening** - Best practices for secure containers

### **Section 5: Infrastructure as Code**
- **IaC Introduction** - Managing infrastructure through code
- **On-Premises IaC** - Security for local infrastructure automation
- **Cloud-based IaC** - Securing cloud infrastructure deployments

## 🎓 Skills I'll Develop

### **Technical Competencies**
- **Pipeline Fortification** - Building secure CI/CD workflows
- **Infrastructure Automation** - Managing infrastructure securely through code
- **Container Security** - Securing modern application deployment
- **Automated Testing** - Implementing SAST/DAST in pipelines
- **Dependency Management** - Controlling third-party risks

### **Practical Applications**

- Infrastructure as Code security practices
- Automated security testing implementation
- Modern development workflow security

## 💡 Why This Path Matters

This learning journey will equip me with the essential skills to:
- **Bridge the gap** between development and security teams
- **Implement security early** in the development lifecycle
- **Automate security controls** in modern DevOps practices
- **Secure cloud-native applications** and infrastructure
- **Apply practical DevSecOps methodologies** in real-world scenarios

## 🏆 End Goal

Upon completion, I'll earn a **certificate of completion** and have the practical skills to:
- Design and implement secure development pipelines
- Automate infrastructure security
- Secure containerized applications
- Apply DevSecOps principles in professional environments
